# CNC Milling, Molding & Casting
For this week, there are two things I'd like to try:
1. Carve a topographic map of Georgia using the CNC
2. Cast my logo in chocolate

To accomplish both of these, I will be using the CNC.

## Topographic Map of Georgia

## Chocolate Logo
To make my logo chocolates a bit more interesting, I'll make the gradients stronger and then use the luminance values to determine cutting depth. I think chocolate coins are neat, don't have too much chocolate, and can have an impressive amount of detail with such a slim form factor.

I started with modifying my logo so it could be used to generate a relief map:

My logo is a vector, which gives freedom in how large the coins can be. The most popular chocolate coins are usually 1.5 inches in diameter (~36 mm), though there are larger sizes (anywhere from 55 to 125 mm). As a bit of a middleground, I'll make them 44 mm in diameter and 3.5 mm thick.

Now that we know the dimensions, making a blank coin is next.
