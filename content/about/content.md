Greetings! My name is Aubrey Bee-Lindgren and I am currently a rising senior at Decatur High School and from Atlanta Georgia. I am also "dual" enrolled at Oglethorpe University and Georgia Piedmont Technical College (fingers crossed for Georgia Tech). I've been making things and doing mechanical engineering all my life, but have never taken a proper class on the subject so am very excited to be here.

I'll be CAD lead on my school's FIRST Robotics Competition robotics team—Global Dynamics #4026—this coming season and hopefully team captain of our FIRST Tech Challenge team. I work as a private math and chemistry tutor and volunteer at my local makerspace, where I am in charge of the 3D printers.

Outside of engineering, I enjoy materials chemistry and physics, am interested in learning more about topology and combinatorics, and find linguistics and the disaster otherwise known as the English language enjoyable. Ask me about the Fantasy Stork (Racing) Club, if you so desire.

As far as sports go, I do taekwondo, cross country, and policy debate (if that last one counts).
