Greetings! My name is Aubrey Bee-Lindgren and I am currently a senior at Decatur High School and from Atlanta Georgia. I am also "dual" enrolled at Oglethorpe University and Georgia Piedmont Technical College. I've been making things and doing mechanical engineering all my life.

I am the CAD lead on my school's FIRST Robotics Competition robotics teamâ€”team #4026: Global Dynamics. I work as an SI for chemistry at Oglethorpe University and volunteer at the Decatur Makers makerspace, where I am in charge of the 3D printers.

Outside of engineering, I enjoy materials chemistry and find linguistics and the disaster otherwise known as the English language enjoyable.

As far as sports go, I do taekwondo, cross country, and policy debate (if that last one counts).
